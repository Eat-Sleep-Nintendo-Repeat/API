# DEPRECATED‚ùó[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)
Version 1 of the Eat, Sleep, Nintendo, Repeat API is no longer maintained. The reason for discontinuing the project is simple: I want to start over. This codebase has became a mess and since i am in training to become a software developer in my company i leanred so much new stuff i want to bring in.
